## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The frontend development tooling system implements specialized analysis and optimization engines across three core business domains:

1. Package Analysis Engine (`src/frontend_mcp_server/tools/package_tools.py`)
- Frontend dependency categorization and pattern detection
- React ecosystem interdependency validation
- Framework compatibility assessment
Importance Score: 75

2. Tailwind Optimization Engine (`src/frontend_mcp_server/tools/tailwind_tools.py`)
- Utility class conflict resolution
- Accessibility-compliant color palette generation
- Responsive design pattern analysis
Importance Score: 85

3. React Component Analysis System (`src/frontend_mcp_server/tools/react_tools.py`)
- Component performance analysis
- Hook pattern detection and optimization
- Accessibility rule enforcement
- Framework best practices validation
Importance Score: 90

The system integrates these engines through domain-specific validation rules and custom optimization patterns, focusing on cross-framework compatibility and frontend-specific technology relationships between React, Tailwind, and TypeScript ecosystems.
