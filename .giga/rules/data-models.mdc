# data-models

Key Entity Relationships:

1. Package Dependency Model
`src/frontend_mcp_server/tools/package_tools.py`
- Hierarchical representation of frontend package dependencies 
- Framework compatibility classification model
- Cross-framework integration mapping
Importance Score: 85/100

2. React Component Relationship Model
`src/frontend_mcp_server/tools/react_tools.py`
- Component hierarchy and inheritance patterns
- Hook dependency mapping 
- Component-level accessibility metadata
Importance Score: 90/100

3. Tailwind Style Classification Model
`src/frontend_mcp_server/tools/tailwind_tools.py`
- Utility class conflict resolution schema
- Color palette relationship mapping
- Responsive design pattern classification
Importance Score: 80/100

Primary Data Structures:
- Nested framework dependency trees
- Component relationship graphs
- Style pattern classification hierarchies
- Cross-framework compatibility mappings

The models focus on representing complex relationships between frontend technologies, with emphasis on:
- Framework interdependency patterns
- Component inheritance structures
- Style classification hierarchies
- Technology compatibility matrices
