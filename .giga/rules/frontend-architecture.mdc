# frontend-architecture

The frontend architecture implements specialized development tooling across several key domains:

## Package Management System
`src/frontend_mcp_server/tools/package_tools.py`
- Custom dependency analysis system for frontend package patterns
- Framework compatibility validation for React ecosystem components
- Interdependency resolution for frontend packages
Importance Score: 75

## UI Component Optimization
`src/frontend_mcp_server/tools/tailwind_tools.py`
- Utility class conflict resolution engine
- Accessibility-compliant color palette generator
- Responsive design pattern analyzer
Importance Score: 85

## React Component Framework
`src/frontend_mcp_server/tools/react_tools.py`
- Performance analysis engine for component hierarchies
- Custom hook pattern detection and validation
- Component accessibility rule enforcement system
Importance Score: 90

## TypeScript Integration Layer
`src/frontend_mcp_server/tools/typescript_tools.py`
- Type validation for React component props
- Framework-specific type definitions
- Integration validation with React ecosystem
Importance Score: 70

## React Native Extensions
`src/frontend_mcp_server/tools/react_native_tools.py`
- Mobile-specific component validation
- Cross-platform compatibility checker
- Native bridge integration validation
Importance Score: 80

## Flow Integration
`src/frontend_mcp_server/tools/react_flow_tools.py`
- Static type analysis for React components
- Flow-specific optimization patterns
- Type definition generation system
Importance Score: 65

Core architectural patterns focus on:
- Framework interoperability validation
- Component-level optimization
- Cross-framework type safety
- Accessibility compliance automation
- Mobile platform compatibility
